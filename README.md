# ServiceX
A pseudo-services bot wrote for the DGS IRC network

## What is the purpose of this software?
We had a Limnoria bot called X which was hosting channel statistics and a polling system however there were a few hardcoded things I didn't like about Limnoria so I decided to re-invent the wheel.

## How will ServiceX work?
At current, I have multiple models on how ServicesX should be coded.

## Features
* Channel Statistics
* Polling System (Democracy)
* Ensured compatibility with UnrealIRCd specifics
* Verification of users based on NickServ account shown in their WHOIS
* Automatically join a namespace of channels
